Q. Given the heads of two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

Input Format: 
(Pointer/Access to the head of the two linked lists)

num1  = 243, num2 = 564

l1 = [2,4,3]
l2 = [5,6,4]

Result: sum = 807; L = [7,0,8]

Explanation: Since the digits are stored in reverse order, reverse the numbers first to get the or
original number and then add them as â†’ 342 + 465 = 807. Refer to the image below.


Input Format: 
(Pointer/Access to the head of the two linked lists)

l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]

Result: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Explanation: Since the digits are stored in reverse order, reverse the numbers first to get the
original number and then add them as â†’ 9999999 + 9999 = 8999001. Refer to the image below.
