Q. Given the head of a singly linked list, write a program to reverse the linked list, and return the head pointer to the reversed list.

Example 1:

Input Format:

LL: 1   3   2   4 


Output: 3


Explanation: After reversing the linked list, the new head will point to the tail of the old linked list.

Example 2:

Input Format:

LL: 4


Output: 4


Explanation: In this example, the linked list contains only one node hence reversing this linked list will result in the same list as the original.
