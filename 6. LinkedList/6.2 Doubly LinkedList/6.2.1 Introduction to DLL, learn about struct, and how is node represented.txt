1. What is DLL

    -> Uses => going forward and backward in tab



2. Representation

    class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, prev=None, next=None):
        self.prev = prev
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

3. Array -> DLL

    def ArrayToDLL(arr):
        head = Node(arr[0])
        earlier = head

        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            curr = Node(arr[i], earlier)
            earlier.next = curr
            earlier = curr
        return head

4. Deletion of a Node
    i. Head
    ii. Tail
    iii. Kth
    iv. Node


5. Insertion of a Node
    i. before head
    ii. before tail
    iii. before Kth Node
    iv. before a given Node
