1. What is Recursion
2. Base Condition
3. Stack Overflow / Stack Space

    Whenever recursion calls are executed, theyâ€™re simultaneously stored in a recursion stack where they wait for the completion of the recursive function. A recursive function can only be completed if a base condition is fulfilled and the control returns to the parent function. 

    But, when there is no base condition given for a particular recursive function, it gets called indefinitely which results in a Stack Overflow i.e, exceeding the memory limit of the recursion stack and hence the program terminates giving a Segmentation Fault error.

4. Recursion Tree
    A recursive tree is basically a representative form of recursion which depicts how functions are called and returned as a series of events happening consecutively.
